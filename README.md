# Covered Call Strategy Backtest
This repository hosts the codebase for a comprehensive backtest of a covered call options trading strategy. Through a series of Python scripts, we filter raw market data, calculate the returns of various covered call strategies, analyze relevant financial factors, and evaluate the strategies' performance through regression analysis. This project aims to offer insights into the efficacy of covered call strategies under different market conditions and factor exposures.

# Description
The covered call is a popular options trading strategy that involves holding a long position in an underlying asset while simultaneously selling call options on the same asset. The strategy aims to generate income from the option premiums in addition to potential capital gains from the underlying asset. This project backtests the covered call strategy by leveraging historical data to simulate the strategy's performance across different scenarios and factor conditions.

# Files in the Repository
# Filter_Data.py
# Purpose: This script prepares and filters the raw dataset to distill the data into a more manageable and relevant subset for analysis.
# Usage: It processes raw market and options data, applying filters to select only the pertinent information required for further steps in the backtesting process.
# Option_Returns.py
# Purpose: Calculates the returns generated by the covered call strategies over the historical data period.
# Usage: Using the filtered data from Filter_Data.py, this script computes the historical returns of implementing the covered call strategy, factoring in premiums received and any capital gains or losses.
# Factor_Calculation.py
# Purpose: Identifies and calculates various financial factors based on company data within the dataset, which might influence the performance of the covered call strategy.
# Usage: Analyzes company-specific data to compute factors such as earnings, market cap, volatility, etc., that are hypothesized to affect covered call strategy outcomes.
# Regression_Analysis.py
# Purpose: Performs regression analysis to understand the impact of different factors on the returns of the covered call strategies.
# Usage: Takes as input the returns and factors calculated in the previous steps to analyze how these factors correlate with the strategy's performance, providing insights into factor exposure and strategy viability.
